                    <h3>V. Ratings and Reviews</h3>
                    <ul>                    
                        <li>The Platform and other Interactive Areas may allow you to rate (each, a “Rating”) and post reviews (each, a “Review”) of Restaurants. Such Ratings and Reviews are considered Your Content and are governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Ratings and Reviews are not endorsed by AppGOODFOOD, and do not represent the views of AppGOODFOOD or of any affiliate or partner of AppGOODFOOD. AppGOODFOOD does not assume liability for Ratings and Reviews or for any claims, liabilities, or losses resulting from any Ratings and Reviews. We strive to maintain a high level of integrity with our Ratings and Reviews and other aspects of Your Content. Therefore, all Ratings and Reviews must comply with the following criteria: (1) before posting a Rating or Review, you must have had first-hand experience with the Restaurant within the 7-day period prior to your review; (2) you may not have a proprietary or other affiliation with either the Restaurant or any of its competitors; (3) you may not draw any legal conclusions regarding the Restaurants' products, services, or conduct; and (4) your review must otherwise comply with the terms of this Agreement. Any Rating and/or Review that we determine, in our sole discretion, could diminish the integrity of the Ratings and Reviews, the Materials and/or the Platform may be removed or excluded by us without notice.</li>
                        
                        <li>By voluntarily providing your cell phone number to AppGOODFOOD, you agree that AppGOODFOOD may contact you by telephone, SMS, or MMS messages at that phone number, and you hereby consent to receiving such communications for transactional, operational, or informational purposes. You understand and consent that such messages may be sent using an automatic telephone dialing system. You may unsubscribe from receiving text messages from AppGOODFOOD at any time. To revoke your consent to receiving SMS or MMS messages from AppGOODFOOD, please follow the unsubscribe procedures described below.</li>
        
                        <li>When placing orders through the Platform, you may receive two or more order status messages from AppGOODFOOD about each order. To unsubscribe from order-related messages, just reply "STOP" to the number sending the message. To resubscribe, text “START” to the same number from the phone number associated with your account. If you need assistance, text “HELP”. Please note that unsubscribing from one of the branded properties in our Platform will not automatically unsubscribe you from another separately branded property in our Platform. For example, if you unsubscribe from AppGOODFOOD order-related messages, you may still receive order-related messages when you place an order through Seamless, unless you also unsubscribe from Seamless order-related messages.</li>
        
                        <li>Additionally, you may receive messages from AppGOODFOOD following receipt of a completed order soliciting feedback and/or other information relating to the order. You may unsubscribe from all such feedback messages by replying "STOP" to the number sending the feedback messages. To resubscribe, text "START" to the number sending the feedback messages using the phone number associated with your account. Please note that unsubscribing from such feedback texts will not prevent you from receiving texts from AppGOODFOOD, the Restaurant, or your delivery person regarding your order or its delivery unless you also text "STOP" to the number sending the order-related messages, and even in such event, you may still receive individual texts from the Restaurant or your delivery person to enable successful delivery of your order.</li>
        
                        <li>You may also receive text messages in response to certain Customer Care requests. To unsubscribe from Customer Care messages, just reply to the message by texting “STOP” to the number sending the message.</li>
        
                        <li>If you unsubscribe from receiving text messages from AppGOODFOOD through the process described above, you may continue to receive text messages for a short period while AppGOODFOOD processes your request(s). If you change or deactivate the phone number you provided to AppGOODFOOD, you have an affirmative obligation to update your account information and the phone number(s) attached to your account to prevent us from inadvertently communicating with anyone who acquires any phone number(s) previously attributed to you, and any new phone number(s) you attach to your account may receive AppGOODFOOD’s standard SMS or MMS messages unless you also unsubscribe via the above procedures.</li>
        
                        <li>Standard data and message rates may apply for SMS and MMS alerts, whether you send or receive such messages. Please contact your mobile phone carrier for details. </li>
        
                        <li>We may make available software to access AppGOODFOOD’s websites, technology platforms, and related online and mobile services via a mobile device (“Mobile Applications”). To use any Mobile Application, you must use a mobile device that is compatible with that Mobile Application. AppGOODFOOD does not warrant that any Mobile Application will be compatible with your mobile device. You may use mobile data in connection with the Mobile Applications and may incur additional charges from your wireless provider for these services. You agree that you are solely responsible for any such charges.
